# Interactive CV

This app was made using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/).

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm i` and start a development server using `npm run dev -- --open`.

## Building

To create a production build, use `npm run build`. This will produce the build in the `/docs` directory, which is where Github Pages looks for the compiled application.
